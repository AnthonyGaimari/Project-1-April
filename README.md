First group project - Trilogy ###What was required###

Our group used Openweather, Uber, and the transit API to make the user life easier.
Using the AJAX call we were able to pull the cost, distance, estimated time and weather conditions for the user to have as much information about how they will make their choice.
We went for a modern and simplistic design making sure that it was all about the user
For a first time user, by using modals we were able to have an instruction page and used graphics on how to get the user where they need to be.
Repeating Elements- The results of each pull came into tables that we used to display all the information needed.
Bootstrap/CSS Framework- Utlizing Bootstrap, we created the look and feel of our app.
Firebase- To log in and save favorite places, we used the Firebase for storing data that stores favorite locations so the user has the choice of typing in a new location or using one they frequently visit.
Our app was able to be mobile responsive, creating convenience for all the users on the go
